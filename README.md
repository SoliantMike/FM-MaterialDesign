Building user interface in your FileMaker apps are easier than they ever have been, and we now have more tools at our disposal for building custom widgets. That also means there are a ton of options to choose from when designing your user interface. 

One of the first places I turn to for reference and information is the Material Design site [https://material.io] made available by Google. Fair warning, material design is an entire field of study, and you can spend quite a bit of time digging through all the available documentation. This site is a treasure trove of UI ideas and concepts, some of which are directly applicable to your FileMaker development. 

This sample file demonstrates the following design elements in a FileMaker user interface.
